# Batch-Gradient-Descent-Model

Batch Gradient Descent Model for Neural Networks

Here, We created the Batch Gradient Descent Model by adjusting the below parameters to optimize the performance.

1.) Batch Size

2.) Loss Function

3.) Iteration

4.) Epochs 

5.) Learning Rate

Here, we can clearly understand that the model is for Batch Gradient Descent.

Where we gave the Batch Size is entire length of training data.
